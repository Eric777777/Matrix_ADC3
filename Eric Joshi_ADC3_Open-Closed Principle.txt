Open/ Closed Principle (OCP)
Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
The Open Close Principle states that the design and writing of the code should be done in a way that new functionality should be added with minimum changes in the existing code.
The design should be done in a way to allow the adding of new functionality as new classes, keeping as much as possible existing code unchanged.
Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
In example:
 class GraphicEditor {
 	public void drawShape(Shape s) {
 		s.draw();
 	}
 }
 
 class Shape {
 	abstract void draw();
 }
 
 class Rectangle extends Shape  {
 	public void draw() {
 		// draw the rectangle
 	}
 }
